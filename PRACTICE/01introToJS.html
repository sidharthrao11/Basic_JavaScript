    <h1>Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
    <p>1.JavaScript is an event based/event driven programming languge. <br>
         which means whatever events going to happen on our websites is programmed by javascript. <br>
         for i.e. when we click on submit button and are form is going to be submmited. this event possible because of javascript.
    </p>
    <p>2.javascript is lossly Typed or Dynamically Typed Language. <br>
         dynamically typed languge :- those programming languges which is NOT FORCE the user to define datatype before assign value to varible <br>
                                      is called dynamically typed languge! <br>

         statically typed langue :-   those programming languges which is FORCE the user to define datatype before assign value to varible <br>
         is called statically typed languge! e.i. JAVA, C, C++ etc! <br>
    </p>
    <p>3. JavaScript is Interpreted Language. <br>
           it means its portable languge whihch means its easy to run on any machine.
           and easy to debugging.
    </p>
    <p>4. javascript is help us to manipulate our HTML and CSS code. <br>
          as we know it works on events so whatever we've created through using HTML and CSS we can give a perticular behaviour to that design. 
    </p>
    <p>5.JavaScript is Synchronous Single Threaded Language. <br>
        Synchronous Single Threaded Language means one that can execute only one task at a time. <br>
    </p>
    <p>6.Different engines have different “codenames”. <br>
          so different different engines have different different code names for javascript <br>
          for i.e. :- 
          <ul>
            <li>V8 – in Chrome, Opera and Edge.</li>
            <li>SpiderMonkey – in Firefox.</li>
            <li>
              …There are other codenames like “Chakra” for IE, “JavaScriptCore”,
              “Nitro” and “SquirrelFish” for Safari, etc.
            </li>
          </ul>
    </p>
    <p><h2>7.History</h2>
        <p>JavaScript was founded by Brendan Eich in 1995</p>
        <p>At that time JavaScript was with NetScape but now owened by Oracle</p>
        <p>Standardized by Ecmascript</p></p>
